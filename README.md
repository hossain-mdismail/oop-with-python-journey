### Object-Oriented Programming with Python â€” My Learning Journey

Welcome to my OOP journey with Python! This repository contains my daily progress as I explore and learn the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) from scratch.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into classes and objects. By structuring code this way, OOP enhances code reusability, modularity, and scalability, making it easier to manage complex systems.

In this repository, I'll document my deep dive into key OOP concepts, including:

Classes and Objects: Structuring code with classes and creating objects.

Constructors and __repr__ Method: Initializing objects and representing them as strings.

Inheritance: Reusing and extending code through class hierarchies.

Polymorphism: Implementing shared interfaces across classes with different behaviors.

Abstraction: Hiding unnecessary details and exposing essential features.

By the end of this project, I aim to have a solid understanding of OOP principles in Python, providing a strong foundation for more advanced topics.
